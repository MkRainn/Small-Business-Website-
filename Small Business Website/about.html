                        After successfully running a computer shop and a gym, Jesus, who has nearly ten years of business experience, decided to pursue his dream of operating a tapsihan. 
                        The journey hasn't always been straightforward; challenges like fluctuating revenue and shifting clientele have tested his resolve. However, Jesus believes that with 
                        perseverance, commitment, and hard work, success is achievable. R & C Tapsihan is fueled by his desire to support his family, especially his grandchildren, helping them 
                        realize their dreams of becoming pilots. Each day at the restaurant brings him closer to that goal, with the support and encouragement of his loved ones. 
                        We invite you to try R & C Tapsihan. Join us on our journey, rooted in family, passion, and the belief that persistence truly pays off.
